## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

### Setup
This project uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) as the runtime environment. If you don't already have Visual Studio Code or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), download and install them now.

- Open this project in Visual Studio Code.
- In the `.devcontainer/` folder, create a file called `.env` whose contents look like this example replacing the placeholders with your credentials:
```sh
GIT_USERNAME=johnkntran # replace with your own registered GitHub username
GIT_EMAIL=tran.spam@yahoo.com # replace with your own registered GitHub email
```
- Open the Command Palette by clicking `View -> Command Palette...` or clicking `Command + Shift + P` on Mac or `Control + Shift + P` on Windows.
- In the palette, type `> Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...` and choose this project folder.
- Once the project loads up, go to http://127.0.0.1:3000 to see the running app.
